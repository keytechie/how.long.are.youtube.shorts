The maximum duration of a Youtube Shorts video is 60 seconds.
The ideal duration is between 15 and 60 seconds.
It looks simple, doesnâ€™t it? But there are some restrictions based on the type of music you choose.

If you are using Stock music or your own Audio, your video can be between 15 and 60 seconds.
But, if you are choosing a music track from the YouTube catalog, then your video duration will be limited to up to 15 seconds.
